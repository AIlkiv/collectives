## 🌱 Bring life to your collective

Create pages and share the knowledge that really matters.

Click the "Create a Page" button in the upper left
and a new page will appear.

You can type in a title right away
or add some content first
and settle on a title later.

## 🛋️ Edit the landing page to feel like home

When you create a new collective it will start with some initial
content.
Push the pencil button on the top left of the start page ↗️
to adjust it to your collectives needs.

## 🐾 Add your comrades to the collective

Members can be managed in the [Circle App](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/circles)

If your nextcloud instance is configured to allow groups in circles
you can even add entire groups to your collectives.
